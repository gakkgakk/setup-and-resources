# Non-developer programs

This file has suggestions for some types of programs that are useful to have.

## Password manager

Very useful, [bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) works well and is free to use.

## 2 factor authentication app

Some sites demand this during authentication, [authy](https://authy.com/) works fine.

## Note taking

[Logseq](https://logseq.com/) is free and pretty good. Takes some time to learn.

## Project management

[Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/). This is a web app so nothing to do with ubuntu, but put it here anyway. I really like it.
